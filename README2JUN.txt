With MasterExample.csv, Locations.csv, going.csv and clustfunc.csv in the same
directory, run "prototype.py"

if you want to vary some data, open going.csv and change some "no" to "yes"
or vice versa.  I have a lot of j names, so just to experiment, I turned all
the non j names to no's to verify that only j names were mapped, but that was
arbitrary


we shouldn't need Master.py or DatGen.py or 1MakeDict.py anymore in this
repository. I'll keep those in an "old" directory, and I suggest you do the same
but for now, having them in the repository is distracting
